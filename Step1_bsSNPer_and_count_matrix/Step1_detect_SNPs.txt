# SNPs were filtered using BS-SNPer from https://github.com/hellbelly/BS-Snper, Gao Shengjie, Zou Dan, Mao Likai, et al. BS-SNPer: SNP calling in bisulfite-seq data[J]. Bioinformatics, 2015, 31(24): 4006-4008.
# BS-SNPer detects SNPs from bam files (bisulfite sequencing). Also a genome file is needed (hg19.fa in this example)

# If you have several samples from each individual, combine them, e.g. samtools merge -cp Case1_merged.bam Case1_sample1.bam Case1_sample2.bam
# (In this project we just had one per individual)

# Before running BS-SNPer, you need to remove lambda phage reads from the bam files in case the alignment was done simultaneously on lambda and the reference genome

# Ran this as an array job. In this project one day was enough (for bam files of size 1-3 GB) but in other projects I've needed two weeks. Depends on the size of the bam files.
