# This is an example of running RADMeth, testing for differential methylation associated with sex (needs to be run separately for each covariate of interest).
# Please refer to the MethPipe manual for a documentation of the usage of RADMeth: http://smithlabresearch.org/downloads/methpipe-manual.pdf
# The time and memory requirements are much smaller than for PQLseq. For me, 100M memory and a couple hours were enough. I ran this as an array job, 56 jobs and 50000 CpG sites per job, 173 samples.

~/apps/methpipe-3.4.3/bin/radmeth regression -factor sex $DESIGN $PROP_TABLE > $OUT_FILE

# Then combined the outputs, sorted by chromosome and location (similarily as in tep3_differential_methylation_PQLseq/Step3_Create_bed_file_each_covariate.R), excluded CpG sites for which RADMeth didn't converge (removed rows that contained -1 in column 5) and ran the p-value adjustment step:

~/apps/methpipe-3.4.3/bin/radmeth adjust -bins 1:200:1 rad_sorted_converged_sex_full.bed > rad_adjusted_sex_full.bed

# RADMeth's own method for the detection of differentially methylated regions:
radmeth merge -p 0.01 rad_adjusted_sex_full.bed > dmrs_sex_full.bed
